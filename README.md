Scholarship management project
This repo contains all the files and code that i used in this project. 

A Smart contract is a contract that runs on the blockchain network. Blockchain is a
decentralized network system in which every node is having information about every
transaction in the form of blockchain which is present at every node. Smart contract for Central
Sector Scholarship (CSS) Scheme is a contract between the Central Board of Secondary
Education (CBSE) and the students enrolled in the CSS scheme. This is an automated version of
the existing Central Sector Scholarship (CSS) Scheme. Students have to apply for the scholarship
by submitting an online form. CBSE then verifies the details and provide a fixed amount to the
students according to some guidelines. This helps the students financially in their higher
studies. Smart contract for CSS scheme provides a user-friendly and secure system for CSS
scheme. Student can easily apply for the scheme and can keep track of his/her application
status. Human effort done by the college staff gets reduced by a large factor. Smart contract for
CSS scheme automates the whole process at CBSEâ€™s end. The manual checking is replaced by
the automated version of CSS Scheme.
A Smart contract is a contract that runs on a blockchain network. CBSE and students are part of
a private blockchain on which the smart contract for CSS Scheme is running. This makes the
smart contract decentralized. If any system in the network gets affected by some malicious
activities others will continue to run safely and securely. It greatly reduces the threat of hacking
and theft of funds. Since it is a private blockchain, every member can be added to the
blockchain only by CBSE. Smart contract for CSS scheme is an improvement over traditional CSS
scheme in many aspects. It is user-friendly, eco-friendly, traceable and much more secure.
Security is a challenge faced in every field. Smart Contract for CSS scheme is based on
distributive systems that provide security of a certain level because there is not a single point of
failure. Obtaining a fully secured application is still a work in progress, however, in Smart
Contract based CSS Scheme, some security measures have been taken to provide security and
prevent malicious attacks.
